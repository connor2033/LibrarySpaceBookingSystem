To install all needed requirements:

1. Ensure you have python3 installed.

`python --version`

If you do not have python 3.X installed, please install it from python.org.

2. Ensure you have pip installed. If you install Python from source, you should already have pip.

`pip --version`

3. Install pipenv to manage a virtual environment.

`sudo pip install pipenv`

4. Start up your pipenv shell.

`pipenv shell`

If you are getting errors with this command, try installing pipenv again with `sudo pip install pipenv` and then running `pipenv shell` again.


<!-- `pipenv shell` 
`pip install -r requirements.txt` -->
